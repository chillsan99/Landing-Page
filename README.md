# Landing-Page

Hello, Everyone!

This was a landing page that I built using a tutorial by Traversy Media. I decided to follow this tutorial as a way to get to learn how to work with locally cached data on a computer to build something pretty cool and that could be studied and used for future projects.

This page takes your information that your local device has for time, as well as remembers your name, if you decide to put one in.
If your decide does not know your name, you can enter one in and since it saves the data, it should always reference you by name. 

Here is this tutorial if you'd like a look : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

Eventually I wish to branch off a bit more in my own works with this piece to not only include name, and focus but to also include local weather.
